Be sure to check the TrIDLib-License.txt file.
See the website for more info, changes log and samples in various
programming languages. A certain degree of familiarity with how TrID
works will also surely help.

N.B. More detailed docs will come very soon, but for the moment the samples
should enough to start coding.


If you like the free library, you may consider sending a postcard of your
