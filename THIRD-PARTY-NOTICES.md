# Third-Party Notices

magic-extractor's own source is MIT (see `LICENSE.txt`). It does **not**
reimplement the archive formats — it detects a file and shells out to bundled
third-party detector/extractor programs under `cli/bin/`. Each of those keeps
its own license, listed below. **They are not covered by magic-extractor's MIT
license.**

> This file is informational, not legal advice, and licenses/versions can
> change. Before redistributing the bundle, verify each tool's current terms
> against its own `LICENSE`/`readme` in its `cli/bin/` folder.

## ⚠ Restrictive — verify before redistributing

These are proprietary / shareware / non-commercial and may **not** be freely
bundled in a distributed product. Confirm terms (or drop them / require the user
to supply them):

| Tool | Used for | Terms |
|------|----------|-------|
| `alzip/ALZipCon.exe` (ESTsoft) | ALZ, EGG | **Shareware.** Free for individuals; companies/for-profit/public orgs/Internet cafes must buy a license. Bundling in a product is a concern. |
| `rar/UnRAR` (RARLAB) | RAR | UnRAR EULA: freely distributable, but must **not** be used to recreate the RAR compression algorithm / build a RAR-compatible archiver. |
| `uharc` | UHARC | Freeware, typically **non-commercial** use only. |
| `unace` | ACE | Proprietary freeware; redistribution terms unclear. |
| `dgca` | DGCA | Japanese freeware, proprietary. |

Licenses tagged **verify** were inferred (no bundled LICENSE file); confirm from
the upstream project before relying on them.

## GPL/LGPL note

Several tools are GPL/LGPL. magic-extractor only **executes** them as separate
programs (subprocess), which is aggregation, not linking — so magic-extractor's
own MIT license is unaffected. But redistributing the GPL binaries still
requires offering their corresponding source (or a written offer), per GPL.
